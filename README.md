# CogPainExp-Desktop-Beta
MRI experiment desktop-based VR task from 'The cognitive basis of pain learning'. 
This simplified beta version is only for participants BEFORE the experiment.


## 0. What to do in the task?

You will conduct a computer-based navigational task in a virtual environment by moving the mouse to control the movement direction. 

Play this version at yout home to see if you have any motion sickness or other uncomfortable experience before coming to the experiments. 
DM for enquiry.


## 1. Launch the app

Download the whole folder and do not move any files away from it.

Open the task ('CogPainLearningExp.exe' for Windows). 
Notice this game is the version without any real shocks, which will be applied along with the complete version of this game. 

*The shock-independent verison with visible monetary punishment is available. DM for requirement.


## 2. Start the task

Enter subject name as you like, or simply leave it as blank. 
Keep it the same for all three sessions.
 
Leave session number and cream side as blank. 
Notice the game may fail to run in this version if you input anything as session number.

Click on the Start button and enjoy!


## 3. Shock calibration

Shock calibration is only asked in the real experiment. Press Q button once to jump over each scene when you are asked for rating shocks.

If you see the development console on the bottom-left corner (probably because you click mouse for several times), press Close button to close the console.


## 4. What will happen in the task?

This task is for a navigation in a 3-by-3 grid virtual maze. 
At the start of each trial you would be born in the centre room and face towards north.

You are always forced to move forward, and you could only move your mouse/trackball/joystick around to change the moving direction. 
Try to practice turning left, right, and U-turn in each room.
Use the sun in the north (a little bit west), shadows on the ground, and compass on the top screen to help you navigate.
Time countdown for the ongoing trial is shown as a red number on the top-right screen.

You will always see the rewards obtained in the current trial both in the top-left and in the bottom progress bar:

    You will obtain a invisible coin (10p) every time you enter into the a new room.
    The real-time accumulated reward is shown both on the top-left screen and as a comprehensive progress bar on the bottom screen.
    You need to step into the room a bit to obtain the coin.
    You are encouraged to keep moving from room to room in order to obtain rewards as many as possible,
    as staying in the same room would not give you a second coin unless you reach the other room.
    At the end of each trial you will be informed of the real-time accumulated rewards across trials you obtained. 
    This counts for your final performance reward you could obtain for the real experiment.

At the end of each trial, you will be asked to choose which you think is the most dangerous turn/region (instruction figure given) as well as rate the certainty of your choice.
You will also be asked to self-rate the pain level of shocks and cream you have experienced in the trial.
Simply ignore these choices by pressing Q button.
These will be paid attention to during the real experiment.


## 5. What to do when finishing all sessions?

For any uncomfortable experience when playing this game, contact yijia.yan@ndcn.ox.ac.uk as soon as possible BEFORE the experiment.


## What to do when getting tired?

You will have short breaks between every two trials. I would be verily grateful for your completion of each trial, as each trial will end in merely several minutes.

Yet if you get verily quite tired of staying in the current block, press Q 
to quit (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD) and go to the next trial.
You need to conduct this during the navigation scene.

If you get verily tremendously quite tired and want to exit the whole task, press Esc (participants can’t do this in the formal experiment XD).
You need to conduct this during the navigation scene.


## ATTENTION

Do not press other keyboard buttons not mentioned above!
